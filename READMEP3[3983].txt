Boggle is a challenging word‐finding game that can be played in as little as 3 minutes and can be 
played by two or more players. The Goal was to turn Boggle into a multi‐player networked game consisting of a single server program 
which will interact with two clients. 

The working of the game can be slpit up into three stages,

Stage 1: The server is started and allows multiple clients to connect.

Stage 2: The server will create a random 4 X 4 Boggle board arranged in a cube and send this information to each client. 

Stage 3: The server stops accepting guesses after 3 minutes and starts to tabulate the results by eliminating the duplicate words from each player’s list and score the remaining words according to Boggle's rules.

Stage 4: And Finally after the server sends the results to each client, it terminates and ends the game.
